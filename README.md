# Overview

This software is an audio splitting software that allows you to input an audio file and manipulate it to produce multiple different audio file chinks from that onme file. This software is written in Python using the PyDub library. The purpose of this software is to simplify the training of new employees working in customer service and sales by demonstrating different portions of a professional call. Below is a link to the demonstration of my software at work.
